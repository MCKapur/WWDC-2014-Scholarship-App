WWDC-2014-Scholarship-App
=========================

My WWDC 2014 scholarship app. It's a voice assistant that can answer over 40 questions about me (and math, science, GK), but you can also expand into a native detail view to learn more.

The app won't compile, I've excluded the "RKConfig" file (.gitignore) which contains my Wit and Wolfram Alpha keys. If you use your own Wit instance, the app obviously still won't work unless you use the same intents as me.
