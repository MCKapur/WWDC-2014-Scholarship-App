WWDC-2014-Scholarship-App
=========================

My WWDC 2014 scholarship app. It's a voice assistant that can answer over 40 questions about me (and math, science, GK), but you can also expand into a native detail view to learn more.

Currently, I've removed my Wolfram Alpha key from the "RKConfig" file, as I only have ~100 API calls left (out of 200). So the WolframAlpha math, science and general knowledge questions won't work. Alternatively, you can get your own Wolfram Alpha App ID and use it yourself.
